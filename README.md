## Chinese Poetry Frontend
* You can see my web page [**HERE**](https://tolivein.github.io/diamond_react/), I just deploy it to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
* Since I haven't config the cert, it will show "unsafe", you can manage to access it, I believe.
* **The backend repo is now private......**
* Although now the web page is simple, I'll continue to improve it.

## Develop with React, Typescript, Rxjs, React hooks.
* I just want to use some new awesome things to do something I want to :), so I didn't use JS, class components, etc.

## Github Actions to CI/CD.
* Now just the frontend.

## Data source is Chinese Poetry repo
* [Chinese poetry](https://github.com/chinese-poetry/chinese-poetry) repo.
